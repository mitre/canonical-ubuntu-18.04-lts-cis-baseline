# canonical-ubuntu-18.04-lts-server-cis-baseline. 

InSpec profile overlay to validate the secure configuration of Canonical Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server against the [Center for Internet Security](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/ubuntu_linux/) - [CIS Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS Benchmark v2.0.1](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/ubuntu_linux/).

## Getting Started  
It is intended and recommended that InSpec and this profile overlay be run from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over __ssh__.

__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.__ 

Latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

## Tailoring to Your Environment

The following inputs may be configured in an inputs ".yml" file for the profile to run correctly for your specific environment. More information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).

```
__*** Once we have them, put some example inputs here ...***__
```
## Long Running Controls

There are a few long running controls that take anywhere from 3 minutes to 10 minutes or more to run. In an ongoing or CI/CD pipelne this may not be ideal. We have supplied an input (mentioned above in the user-defined inputs) in the profile to allow you to 'skip' these controls to account for these situations.

The input `disable_slow_controls (bool: false)` can be set to `true` or `false` as needed in a `<name_of_your_input_file>.yml` file.

## Running This Overlay Directly from Github

Against a remote target using ssh with escalated privileges (i.e., InSpec installed on a separate runner host)
```bash
# How to run 
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/canonical-ubuntu-18.04-lts-server-cis-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz -t ssh://TARGET_USERNAME:TARGET_PASSWORD@TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT --sudo --sudo-password=<SUDO_PASSWORD_IF_REQUIRED> --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json> 
```

Against a remote target using a pem key with escalated privileges (i.e., InSpec installed on a separate runner host)
```bash
# How to run 
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/canonical-ubuntu-18.04-lts-server-cis-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz -t ssh://TARGET_USERNAME@TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT --sudo -i <your_PEM_KEY> --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>  
```

Against a local Ubuntu host with escalated privileges (i.e., InSpec installed on the target)
```bash
# How to run
sudo inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/canonical-ubuntu-18.04-lts-server-cis-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json> 
```

## Running This Overlay from a local Archive copy
If your runner is not always expected to have direct access to GitHub, use the following steps to create an archive bundle of this overlay and all of its dependent tests:

(Git is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below. Git can be downloaded from the [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) site.) 

```
mkdir profiles
cd profiles
git clone https://github.com/mitre/canonical-ubuntu-18.04-lts-server-cis-baseline.git
inspec archive canonical-ubuntu-18.04-lts-server-cis-baseline
sudo inspec exec <name of generated archive> --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json> 
```

For every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this overlay and dependent profiles:

```
cd canonical-ubuntu-18.04-lts-server-cis-baseline
git pull
cd ..
inspec archive canonical-ubuntu-18.04-lts-server-cis-baseline --overwrite
sudo inspec exec <name of generated archive> --input-file <path_to_your_input_file/name_of_your_input_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json> 
```

## Review your scan results with [Heimdall-Lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org)
### What is Heimdall-Lite?
Heimdall-Lite is a great open-source Security Results Viewer by the [MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org) for reviewing your GCP CIS Benchmark scan results.  

Heimdall-Lite is one of many MITRE [Security Automation Framework](https://saf.mitre.org) (SAF) Supporting Tools working to enhance the Security Automation and DevSecOps communities.  

The [MITRE SAF](https://saf.mitre.org) is an open-source community partnership including Government, Industry and the Open Community working together to make truly automated security a reality. It also hosts many InSpec profiles created by the SAF and references to many partner developed profiles - **_including this one_**.  

**Tip**: MITRE hosts Heimdall-Lite on GitHub pages, but you can easily run it in your environment via Docker or NPM or whatever suites your need. See the projects GitHub more information.
   
### Go to Heimdall Lite and Load your JSON formatted Results

1. Navigate to [Heimdall Lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org)
2. Click `Local Files` on the left side of the loader
3. Drag and Drop or select and load your `{{project-id}}_scan.json` file to review your results.
